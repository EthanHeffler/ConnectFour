ConnectFour
===========

I've been on a mission to test my jQuery skills. And I thought, why not make a game of it? I have always been a huge fan of Connect Four, so I decided to build it. While doing my research, I discovered some people have done this with classic javascript or used 2 dimensional arrays, but I wanted to do it my own way. I decided to do it with a ton of DOM traversing and not use any arrays.
